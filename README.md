# CSC 165 Final Fake Souls
 _This was a half-semester long project that demonstrates an understanding of game architecture by designing a game independently. The game mainly uses TAGE, a game engine written and designed by California State University-Sacramento's alumni and professors._

## Key features
- Application of various handmade animated models created in Blender.
- The use of game engine features such as lighting, height maps, terrain maneveurability, and networking.
- The use of JBullet, a physics engine, to handle collisions between different entities in the game.
- Application of a quadtree to determine the 2D locations of entities that are inside the game.

## Installing the game
- Requires the installation and configuration of various .jar libraries to run the game, may fix later to not require this.
- Installation of the game assumes Java 11 JDK and JOGL 2.4. 
- The following items needs to be added to the CLASSPATH environment variable
	- jogl-all.jar
	- gluegen-rt.jar
	- joal.jar
	- joml-....jar
	- jinput.jar
	- jbullet.jar
	- vecmath.jar
-  The following item needs to be added to the PATH environment variable
	- ....\jinput\lib

## Setting up networking/Starting the game
- For playing the game on the network, in command line,
	- `.\compileServer.bat`
	- `.\runServer.bat,` leave this window running.
	- Go to a different computer or a new terminal then
	- `.\compile.bat`
	- Edit `.\run.bat` to `java -Dsun.java2d.d3d=false -Dsun.java2d.uiScale=1 a3.MyGame [Host's IP address] 6010 UDP`
	- `.\run.bat` the same instructions for each client.
	- For playing off the network, skip the `.\compileServer.bat` and `.\runServer.bat` instructions.

- Watch out for invaders

## Current issues
- [ ] The game has a problem with the lighting depending on the graphics card the client is using.
	- [ ] TAGE has a problem with running on AMD cards, not sure what to do here
	- Problems with this include:
		- [ ] The game not running at all due to a `NullPointerException` at `updateSSBO`
		- [ ] The game running, but the lighting not being turned on leading to the game just showing black for the textures
		- [ ] The game running, but the enemy entity models not being loaded or being incorrectly loaded in
		- I encountered these issues by running this game on 4 different computers with different setups, not sure how to fix this.

- [ ] Installation of the game should not require the installation of the .jar files mentioned above, they should already be provided when downloading this game
